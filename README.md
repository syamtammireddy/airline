# 🧠 Resolving Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using fMRI and MLP

This repository contains the implementation of our course project:
**"Resolving Autism Spectrum Disorder through Brain Topologies using fMRI and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)"**

Developed under **Course Project – Image and Video Processing (Group B4)**, IIIT Allahabad.

---

## 📄 Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically detect **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using resting-state **fMRI data** from the **ABIDE** dataset.
The system computes connectivity features between brain regions (ROIs) and classifies subjects as **ASD** or **Typical Control (TC)** using a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**.

This project adapts and simplifies the multi-atlas ensemble concept proposed in **MADE-for-ASD (Liu et al., 2024)** to a single, interpretable MLP-based workflow.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Dataset Used:** ABIDE I (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)
* **Data Type:** Resting-state fMRI
* **Subjects:** ~1000 from 17 global sites
* **Demographics:** Age, Gender, and Site details included
* **Phenotype Files:**

  ```
  data/phenotypes/
      Phenotypic_V1_0b.csv
      Phenotypic_V1_0b_preprocessed1.csv
  ```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

> Python 3.8+ recommended (Linux / Mac preferred/Google collab)

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
!pip install -U pip
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install nilearn networkx nibabel scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn h5py
```

Required Python libraries:

```python
import os, numpy as np, pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import networkx as nx
import h5py
```

---

## 🧩 Workflow

### Step 1: Data Preparation

The `prepare_data.py` script computes correlation matrices between Regions of Interest (ROIs) for each subject.

```bash
!python prepare_data.py --folds=3 --whole cc200 aal ez
```

This produces `.hdf5` data files containing:

```
Subject_ID, Connectivity_Matrix, Demographic_Info
```

---

### Step 2: Model Training

Train the **MLP classifier** for ASD vs. TC prediction:

```bash
!python nn.py --whole cc200 aal ez
```

**Model Details:**

* Input: PCA-reduced brain connectivity features
* Layers: [128 → 64 → 32 → 2]
* Activation: ReLU
* Dropout: 0.3
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

---

### Step 3: Model Evaluation

Evaluate trained models on test data:

```bash
!python nn_evaluate.py
```

Generates:

* Accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics
* Confusion matrix and ROC plots
* Classification report summary

---

## 🧠 Running on Test Data

If you want to run the model on **test data** for quick execution, follow these steps:

1. Open

   ```
   B4/prepare_data.py
   ```
2. Locate the phenotype loading line:

   ```python
   pheno = pd.read_csv("data/phenotypes/Phenotypic_V1_0b_preprocessed1.csv")
   ```
3. Replace it with your test file:

   ```python
   pheno = pd.read_csv("data/phenotypes/test_phenotype.csv")
   ```
4. Save and rerun the pipeline.

💡 Running on the **full dataset** may take several hours —
for demonstration or testing, the **test phenotype file** is much faster.
